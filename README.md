# Telegram JS

Client library to access the Telegram API. This package is based on the work of Enrico in the [Telegram Link](https://github.com/enricostara/telegram.link) library.

It's rewritten in ES6 and has far less built-in features and dependencies. It is compatible with [telegram-mt-node](https://github.com/enricostara/telegram-mt-node) and [telegram-tl-node](https://github.com/enricostara/telegram-tl-node), but is not a drop-in replacement.

## Usage
